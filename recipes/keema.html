    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Keema (also spelled kheema) is a popular dish in South Asian cuisine, 
        particularly in Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi cooking. It refers to 
        ground or minced meat, typically lamb, beef, or chicken, which is cooked 
        with a variety of spices and sometimes vegetables. The term "keema" itself 
        simply means minced or ground meat, but the dish made from it can vary widely 
        depending on the region and the recipe.</p>
