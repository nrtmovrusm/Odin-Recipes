    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Chicken Karahi is a popular dish in Pakistani and North Indian cuisine, 
        named after the "karahi," a traditional wok-like pan used to cook it. 
        The dish typically features tender chicken cooked in a rich, flavorful sauce 
        made with tomatoes, ginger, garlic, green chilies, and a variety of aromatic 
        spices like cumin, coriander, garam masala, and sometimes fenugreek leaves. 
        It’s often garnished with fresh cilantro and green chilies, and served with naan or rice.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fry the onions in some oil on high heat until they start to become golden; 
            add garlic, ginger and garam masala </li>
        <li>Once the onions are fully brown, turn the heat to medium-high, 
            add all the spices (except coriander seeds) and continue cooking, being sure that the onions 
            don’t burn to a crisp, but do become very blackish red. Keep on stirring. 
            Add a splash of water if they stick to the bottom of the pan. </li>
        <li>Once the onions turn into a paste, add chicken. Cook on high heat until the chicken 
            is no longer pink on the outside </li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, yogurt and lemon juice, turn the heat to medium, cover and cook until a) 
            there isn’t liquid/curry, but it is a paste and b) oil begins to separate from the gravy</li>
        <li>In the last 5 mins of cooking, add the coriander seeds.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro, green chillies and sliced ginger.</li>
